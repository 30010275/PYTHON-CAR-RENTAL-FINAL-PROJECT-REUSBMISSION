### Plan:

1. **`helpers.py`**
   - Modify the `validate_vehicle_data` function to use more descriptive variable names and add informal comments.
   - Change the `handle_error` function to include casual language in comments and introduce some inefficiencies.

2. **`constants.py`**
   - Alter the `RENTAL_RATES` dictionary to use inconsistent naming conventions for keys and add more conversational comments.
   - Change the `DISCOUNT_THRESHOLDS` dictionary to mix naming styles and provide detailed, informal comments.

3. **`main.py`**
   - Rename functions to use varied naming conventions and add informal comments throughout the code.
   - Introduce unnecessary checks and verbose error messages in user interaction prompts.

4. **`vehicle_service.py`**
   - Change the `list_vehicles` function name to something less conventional and add casual comments.
   - Introduce inefficiencies in the `add_vehicle` function, such as unnecessary checks.

5. **`rental_service.py`**
   - Rename the `rent_vehicle` function to a more casual name and add informal comments.
   - Introduce unnecessary complexity in error handling.

6. **`vehicle.py`**
   - Change method names to be less conventional and add informal comments explaining the logic.
   - Introduce inefficiencies in methods like `rent` and `return_vehicle`.

7. **`rental.py`**
   - Rename methods to be less conventional and add informal comments.
   - Introduce unnecessary checks and verbose error messages in methods.

### Follow-up Steps:
- Review the changes made to ensure they align with the "human-like" coding style.
- Test the application to confirm that functionality remains intact after modifications.
